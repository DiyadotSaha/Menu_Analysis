##Problem Statement: ##
  Menu analytics is an emerging area where the menus from two or more restaurants are compared using natural language processing to gain competitive intelligence about the restaurants. As a demonstration of this we conducted a menu analysis on the menus of two prominent restaurants in Bangalore, India to compare dishes and the similarities between the items. To conduct the analysis we used the item names and the descriptions and ingredients provided in the menus accessible to us.
